## Overview

Akande Shop is a comprehensive e-commerce platform that includes a home page and various shopping pages. The shopping pages are accessible the categories in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Each category displays a collection of products in a card format, complete with product details. 

Clicking on a product card navigates the user to a detailed product page where they can review the product's specifics and add a custom quantity of the item to their cart. The cart, a drawer that slides in from the right side of the screen, displays all the items added by the user, the quantity of each item, and the subtotal. Users can update the quantity or remove items directly from the cart. The cart also features a 'Proceed to Checkout' button, which currently serves as a placeholder for future functionality.

## Key Features

- **Client-Side Routing**: Implemented using React's routing API, the application features dynamic endpoints, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Typechecking**: PropTypes are used to ensure the integrity of data passed to components, enhancing the reliability and robustness of the application.
- **Scoped CSS**: CSS modules are employed to create locally scoped style rules for each component, ensuring styles are encapsulated and conflicts are avoided.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The useEffect hook is utilized to fetch data asynchronously, ensuring the UI is always responsive and up-to-date.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience.
- **Vite**: A modern front-end build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience. It provides fast hot module replacement (HMR) and true on-demand compilation.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: A high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
- **CSS**: A style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.

Additional technologies that are worth mentioning:

- **PropTypes**: A library for typechecking in React. It's used to ensure components receive props of the correct type. If a component receives a prop of an incorrect type, PropTypes will generate a warning message in the console.
- **CSS Modules**: A CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. This leads to a much more manageable codebase, free of naming conflicts.
- **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

## Future Work

The current version of Akande Shop is a demonstration of the potential of React in building dynamic and interactive web applications. Future work will focus on expanding the functionality of the 'Proceed to Checkout' button and integrating a back-end to handle data persistence and user authentication.
